"Bazaars, Freedom and Conversation":http://bazaarsconversationsfreedom.com/bazaars/ is the name of an awesome new book by Rajni Bakshi. The main theme of the book is an exploration of alternatives to conventional, growth based capitalism with its often brutal methods and neoclassical economics with its absurd constructs like homo economicus, etc. Rajni's task is to get the reader to stop treating capitalist dogma as a law of nature and to treat concepts such as money, the market and measures of value as changeable things, as matters of choice and things that can be shaped to suit the needs of the entire planet Earth, and not just those of a select minority of species homo sapiens.

Throughout the book the reader is presented with facts that lie just outside the periphery of the capitalist gaze, such as the illuminating espousal of the rest of Adam Smith's work which shed a completely different light on his "invisble hand". It seems that he never meant what they say he meant - read the book for details. Not content with demolishing one of the cornerstones of market fundamentalist propaganda, she turns her gaze to various market failures, inequities, hypocrisies and patent brutality of a system that holds the absurd belief that profit is more important than people and that nobody owes anyone anything, that there is no such thing as society and that the natural world is an "externality" which need not enter into our calculation of cost.

While marking out a reasonably detailed map of the depletion of social capital, she also presents the too often untold and more often unheard stories of people seeking alternatives to the status quo. From the office of Richard Stallman -- founder of the Free Software Movement -- to the various attempts at alternative currencies and cooperative movements, the author makes the telling point that it is not true that greed and competition are the sole defining characteristics of humankind. She posits and provides ample evidence that sharing, cooperation and the desire for a more fulfilling spiritual existence are as natural impulses as the desire for a better material existence.

The author is also quite nuanced in her approach to the market. She is not one to dismiss it as a barbaric relic of the past. Infact, she sees the bazaar as one of the defining characteristics of human society and celebrates economic freedom as another freedom for humans. What she laments is market fundamentalism, the intrusion of the market in places it doesn't belong, the suboptimal outcomes it produces and the conversion of the "market economy" into a "market society". The author treats the bazaar as an important factor in providing a place for humans to gather, to exchange not just the produce of their labour but also to be together as social beings in a community gathering. It is the conversion of the bazaar into a "market" for the cold exchange of commodities that she disapproves of.

While the book is meant for a lay audience, there is no doubt as to the political sophistication of the author. She is one of the rare voices of humanity in a country ravaged by popular images of material success as the final goal of every activity, and the book represents a rare synthesis of many of the themes that have been troubling thinking people. The author's research is impeccable and the book is chock full of astonishing nuggets of information. To top it all off, it is very nicely written with wonderful stories to illuminate the points that the author is making. 

All in all, this book is highly recommended if you are feeling dissatisfied with the status quo and represents a very solid yet accessible starting point into left literature.

A venerable institution of Mumbai is moribund. Bollywood lies gasping in a shallow puddle of its own ineptitude. When my wife - a dedicated follower of Bollywood - suddenly started skipping films, I realised something was horribly wrong. It all started, in my estimation, with the producer's strike. Whatever the reasons, the strike has contributed significantly to this state of affairs. It made people realise that they could live without movies, and perhaps that their life might even be better for it. The extra Rs. 1000 a week was probably being deployed elsewhere at better bang for buck. 

Bollywood chose to end the strike with a choice that destroyed it. The first film after the strike was "Kal Kisne Dekha" starring newcomer Jackie Bhagnani , a most cynical choice of film. The film community could at this point have shown that it really cared about it's audience and released a big starrer to draw the crowds back. Instead, the MBAs walking the corridors of power in Bollywood today counted up the beans and decided that no, we lead with a flop - that way New York will seem better than it actually is. This choice was fatal.

Here are some pictures I took at PVR a few weeks ago, and one of Fun Republic today. These are of course isolated incidents and I present them as indications rather than proof of a crisis. Judge for yourself from your own experience.

Meanwhile, the VPs of New Product development continue to fawn over the stars and engage in ritual self love. Reading their tweets is quite instructive. One such young man saw fit to wish Lara Dutta a happy puppy day. Meanwhile, box office registers resound with the deafening sounds of silence. The only people at Fun Republic yesterday were there to see Alphaville, a sublime film by the master Godard and a sentimental offering from Chabrol called Le Beau Serge which was nonetheless far more satisfying than the recent tepid produce from Bollywoodland. To be noted also is that these screenings, located as they were in the heart of film producer land (Lokhandwala), still managed to attract precisely zero people from the production companies. Apparently, there is nothing that these people need to learn from Godard and Chabrol or any of the other new wave directors on at the French New Wave Film Festival.


This is what happens when you deny the proles a decent education. You end up with a nation that has no way to entertain itself, let alone achieve anything else. Reading Rajni Bakhi's new book "Bazaar, Conversations and Freedom" (a more detailed review once I finish it), I learnt an interesting fact. The author of England's blueprint for the welfare state said that it was imperative to provide the minimum to everyone because without it, the nation would fall prey to, among other things, idleness. This is interesting because the conventional view is that giving things to people for free breeds idleness, atleast according to the capitalists. However, a cursory glance at what drivers do during their massive waitings everyday easily confirms Lord Beveredge's thesis - a person without education can do nought but be idle. Only education enables him to become productive.

The state film development corporations (NFDC, CFSI and Films Division) are also not performing. Where is their output? How hard is it choose maybe 50 directors a year and give them a couple of crore to experiment freely? After all, film making is not just socially useful but it is economically important too. film theaters draw audiences which support the local economy of restaurants and shops. Without film makers, these economies collapse. The desolation at Fun Republic was mirrored in the restaurants of Lokhandwala's main strip. 

Laxmikant's "The Man Beyond the Bridge", which won an award at Toronto, is never going to get a release. The distribution system will ensure that Bela Negi's refreshing film Dayen Ya Bayen is probably going straight to TV as well. These are just two instances that I know of. There are also many, many talented indivduals who will never get a break because those who have to judge their projects simply do not have the analytical tools to do so. Replacing the "lala" producer with a business professional has been a big mistake. Atleast the lala is susceptible to whimsy and there is a chance that he will take a risk on something. Organisations, on the other hand, are coldly rational, risk averse and worst of all, love profit more than cinema. They are paying the price now, but there is no guarantee that they will learn the right lessons. Numerology, astrology, recession and a host of other reasons will be pulled out to justify the state of affairs, but no one will be able to see that the fault lies in the films, and the people making those films. After all, as Godard points out in Alphaville, organisations have an imperative to not just survive but also to grow as big and strong as possible. The state of affairs is not going to improve, even with the collapse of several producers.

Meanwhile, the light of Mumbai's soul grows dim. Business has ruined another beautiful thing.

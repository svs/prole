Today, a document arrived in my inbox with the charming title of "Inverting the Pyramid" and a wonderful cover which shows a ladder leaning against nothing at all, quite apt when you consider the subject matter of the document - Indian microfinance. While we won't go into the microfinance bit at all in this post, please allow me a moment while we talk about the title.

"Inverting the Pyramid" is of course a reference to CK Prahlad's brilliant insight that human society is arranged like a pyramid, if you will, with a lot of poor people and only a few rich ones. Inverting the pyramid would entail changing this situation so that there are lots of rich people and only one or two poor ones. Apart from the charming naivete involved in this image, there also seems to be the unspoken conceit that microfinance is the tool to invert the pyramid. There's just one problem with this approach. Microfinance is very complicated. You need some capital (or a lot), friends at the banks, a relentless hunger for profit, tight opertions involving branches, centers, and meetings, cash to handle, new products to think up and offer, MIS systems and biometric devices to evaluate, audits to conduct, human resources to manage and so on and so forth. I have a simpler solution for inverting the pyramid.

While it may or may not help to do this physically, mentally upending your notions for a little while will make the pyramid seem inverted, somewhat like staring at a stereogram long enough reveals the third dimension. Still finding it hard? Let me explain.

If you look at the world without the prejudices that have been instilled in you by your education or your upbringing, you will find that actually the world is an inverted pyramid. At the bottom, there are a very few dirty bastards, lazy fucks with no skills, questionable morals and absolutely no capacity for hard work. A supremely pampered lot, they can neither withstand variations in temperature nor can they go any length of time without a meal. Their capacity for pain is negligible and they require vast interventions of chemical substances, hospitals and indentured servants called doctors to maintain their health. Sometimes they lift weights, but mostly the weight they move around is their belly. Physically, they are mostly repulsive. Their major preoccupations are pieces of paper called money, the logo and brand of their personal belongings and whether they have more of these two things than anyone else. Their entire sense of worth comes from these things. they often do not care even about their close relatives. They communicate over great distances, often through blinking earpieces or other plasticky devices, but they rarely have anything but "banalities to share":http://twitter.com. If they give someone Re. 1, no matter how clearly that person is suffering and no matter how little that Re. 1 matters to them, they will not give any other person Re. 1 unless the sun has risen again, whereas they are perfectly capable of splurging thousands on a meal which they will then fill their toiletbowls with throughout the rest of the day. Their sense of place and time is so confused that sometimes they don't know which country they live in. Sometimes, they cannot even tell a human being apart from an animal. They treat the sacred earth as though it were toilet paper, to be used and thrown. Generosity is a meaningless word to them. This is really a pitiable sort. Thankfully, there are not so many of these specimens.

On the top of the pyramid we find a completely different kind of human. This is a human who is hardy, who has the capacity for labour, who has real skills. He can build a house, grow food, make things. He has no need for so many of the things that his bottom dwelling compatriot finds necessary - air conditioners, cars, shoes, shampoos. He lives his whole life without them. He understands where his food, water and other necessities come from and he uses them carefully, husbanding the earth and the water. He consumes little. He is forced to work very hard, but he spends his leisure time playing with his family or praising the sacred. The meaning in his life comes from his family and his God. He has an immense capacity for suffering. He bears his pain with a heartbreaking dignity. He watches armies and emperors come and go. He has no need for industrial institutions. He gives up the produce of his work, mostly without complaint. He awaits his salvation in another life. If a bottom dweller enters his humble abode, he is treated with respect, given a meal or a cup of tea, far more than he himself might expect to receive in the bottom dwellers lavish abode. This man is to be respected. His suffering is to be admired and his way of being is to be aspired to. We are fortunate that the vast majority on earth are like this.

There is no need to invert the pyramid.

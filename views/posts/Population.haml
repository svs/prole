!{float:left}http://ramparts360.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/overpopulation-scales1.jpg! The thing about population is that any statement you make about population is more a political statement than a statement of fact. The simple reason for this is that in reality, we have absolutely no fucking clue how many people there are on this fair planet of our's. Sometimes, when certain unverifiable facts are taken by the entire world to be almost self-evident, it might be useful to apply a little homegrown cynicism to these "facts"

The bulk of the world's people, it seems, live in India and China, some 2.5 odd billion people out of 6 or 7 billion on the whole planet. Do you seriously expect me to take these numbers at face value? Are you saying that our wonderful census department (and I suppose China's equally wonderful one) managed to count, to within a reasonably degree of accuracy, all these people by the simple expedient of sending out armies of poorly paid and unmotivated census takers? In India, it could be argued, there is significant incentive to manipulate the census numbers since electoral districts are based on population, as are other government handouts. I'm not saying that UP does not have 200 million people. I'm just saying that I don't know, and in fact, given the odds, I can be reasonably certain that any number you tell me has about equal chance of being close to the real number as it does of being totally off the fucking map.

So, since we're now looking at the world through eyes innocent, what does it mean when says things like "Overpopulation is the number one problem on earth." ? One of the things it could mean is that the speaker of this sentence is a genocidal fascist. I'm speculating here but amongst the tonier drawing rooms on the subcontinent (where overpopulation is not someone else's problem you see, where you have the luxury of compassion. Here it is a very real problem, very real), the vision one gets when one thinks of overpopulation is of ragged people with no resources surrounded by fly infested children, dirtying the whole place, filling the slums and generally straining the infrastructure and public resources of what would otherwise be a country that one could show off proudly to the West. !{float:right}http://isiria.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/overpopulation1.jpg! This image can quite easily be seen from the window of any Mercedes in the suburbs of Mumbai, or experienced closely from the back seat of a rickshaw in any metropolis in India, and so it is not surprising that it springs so readily to mind. Neither is it surprising that people tend to place the blame on those unwashed, diseased people because after all anyone who shits on their own front step is clearly and quite obviously to blame in this depressing scene. Why, people like Atanu Dey who write tome after tome of hateful bile on India's development even go so far as to offer these people the helpful suggestion that they should stop having children because it ruins the aesthetics of his city. I have a suggestion for people like Atanu and others so concerned about overpopulation, perhaps even some people in the West who worry about the future of a world with 9 billion or 12 billion people. The suggestion is as follows

bq. Why don't you chop your fucking head off?

After all, the concern with overpopulation is a concern for the biosphere, for the Earth (our green and pristine paradise) who needs protecting from the people who will chop all her forests and poision her air and water. And so, where better to start with than the hyperconsumptive West, whose small populations hit way above their weight when it comes to raping the earth? One might also start in the tony neighbourhoods of Mumbai and Delhi, whose 2% or 3% of the Indian population is nonetheless responsible for almost all the resource exploitation in India. And carry on to the gated communities of Beijing and Melbourne and so on and so forth. Once these people are gone, overconsumption will no longer be a problem as the rest of the world seems to manage to still live a life consuming mostly vegetables and grains, using miniscule amounts of hydrocarbons and keeping their populations in check through a mature approach to illness, suffering and death.

The explosion in the population of so-called "poor people" is mainly due to the industrial interventions for reducing mortality and fertility. Do you feel this was necessary? Do you feel that people in primitive or agrarian communities died from lack of preventable measures like washing hands after crapping or contamination of food and water sources from shitting willy nilly? You do? Congratulations &#8211; you have an industrial mind. Do you feel that women were nothing but receptacles for sperm, constantly pregnant and ill and oppressed? Congratulations again. Could it be that I support these abominations? Actually, I do not. The thing I am skeptical about is the conviction that life was necessarily like that, and the conviction that logic, rationality and the industrial approach are necessarily superior to a mystical mind which seeks to accept its fate with fortitude rather than rail against it. Do check out "Female Reproductive Health: An Anthropological Perspective":http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ISW/is_2002_Jan/ai_81138280/?tag=content;col1

If you drive through UP in the baking heat of summer, you might see a sight that revolts the rational mind. A marriage celebration at midday, when the heat waves from the macadam distort the view and the heat will dry your eyes and the inside of your lungs. A marrige celebration with the band going full swing, little children dancing in the street (some of them barefoot) and a groom on a horse in a heavy bandgalla. It is a full blown celebration of community in such adverse circumstances that it is not logical, not rational, not at all. We industrial people drove by in our car, the airconditioner on full blast. The "primitive" village people seem to have perfected the art of not needing one. Heat, cold, rain &#8211; they are all the same. They are all nothing. Am I an evil person who wants to deny the benefits of technology to the poor? I ask &#8211; what benefits? The severe dependence on hyrocarbon use? The addiction to screens? The destruction of communities? The commodity fetish? In return for some temperature control which has quite evidently not been a problem for the vast majority of humans for millenia and continues to be so? In return for some speed which <a href="https://clevercycles.com/energy_and_equity/">creates more distances than it bridges</a> ? In return for Deepwater Horizon? In return for the destruction of the awareness of the sacred and the sublime, the holy forests, the lakes and streams that are God incarnate? In return for such overweening complexity that every man has to be just a cog, a specialist in a huge machine rather than an agent of his own will? Damn right I am.

So, to return to our original point - any statement about population is a political statement based as it is on some dubious "facts" and some very deep seated assumptions of right and wrong which in the end are moral choices and not objective facts like the weight of a hydrogen atom. To those who fear overpopulation, pray for an end to the populations of the developed world. The logical end point of industrialisation which promises leisure and comfort for all is an unattainable lie. Primitive people have long known that labour and rest, pleasure and pain, life and death, heat and cold are all part of one whole. Industrial societies all want to save labour, they see pain as something to be conquered, death as something to be delayed for as loing as possible, other people are inconveniences who prevent the full flowering of the individual. It is industrial society's inability to fill the spiritual holes it has created that leads to the statement - the real problem facing the world is overpopulation. In other words, the world would be fine if it weren't for other people.

It is a death wish.

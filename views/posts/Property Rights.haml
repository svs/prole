One of the things proponents of property rights don't tell you about is all the harm that property rights do. The list of actual such incidents is endless and any attempt to make an exhaustive list would be futile, so no need to bother about that. It might however be possible to make some broad generalisations about the process at work within society which does it so much grevious harm.

*All corruption flows from property rights*
Think about it. This means that the argument for equality need not even be cloaked in moral imperatives. It is enough to say that a atleast for a society where corruption is so rampant, where it is doing so much grevious harm to so many of its citizens, there can be no place for the unlimited accumulation of property. Infact, the situation in India is so perverse that there is no option but to be corrupt. There is no social safety net and rock bottom in India is a very hard place. The only comfort and dignity in India is in ones private property. And so you have this survival imperative to attain property which means food missing from the PDS, money missing from the roadworks, from the buses, from te trains, from the customs, from the police, from the municipal corporation, from the builders and the mafia where it flows into the black market and can only be used for consumption. Meanwhile the children go in tatters to schools, the roads suffer gaping potholes, the local train system is an antiquated embarrasment, the buses are a disgrace, the mangroves have disappeared, the health system is broken and the corrupt and the greedy appear defiant on the front page in front of the Audi and the house and the fat children. Out on bail now. 

 This corruption has now caugt the country in a vice grip. It is doubly insulting because not only does it divert money away from productive resources but it diverts them into pure consumption. Since the need for infrastructure development in India is greater than the need for conumption expenditure, this diversion represents a double loss to the economy. And we're not even counting the lost taxes on money spent in the black market.

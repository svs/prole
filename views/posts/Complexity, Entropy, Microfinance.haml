Many of us like to think of history as a deterministic process - certain great individuals and institutions shaped the future of their civilization or the Earth or the story of man. It gives the human race a certain sense of control about its destiny and it just seems to make sense because after all history is histoire is historia is a story and a story has protagonists, actors, agents, drama. While there certainly have been many great men on this planet, it is not certain whether they were the shapers of history, the products of history or just the hapless puppet on the string of History, playing his or her part. What is certain though is that this mode of story-telling leaves out always one critical player in the whole scheme of human affairs - the lovable rogue, the double edged sword, the mixed blessing, that pandora's box - energy.

In the dark times, when humans were still hunter gatherers, human society was very simple. Little better than the animals around us, we lived in tribal groups, ate what we could get our hands on or kill and generally led very simple lives. The average human would know a certain number of facts related to his daily survival and would spend any free time he had getting high around the campfire, or roughhousing with the children. Of course times were brutal, but they were about to get much more so.

The discovery of agriculture led for the first time to a surplus of energy. People spend much time arguing about whether it is morally defensible for some to appropriate the produce of others. Others bemoan that fall from grace, that bad decision that condemned mankind to internecine warfare - private property. What is often forgotten is that there might have been no choice.

The consumption of energy expresses itself in one way - the doing of work - and the doing of work expresses itself in terms of entropy - the reduction of disorder where the work is done and a corresponding increase in the complexity of a system. Houses came to be built, which now needed maintainence. Farms and farmyard animals needed tending. Accounts need to be kept. An accountant class needed to be housed and clothed. Their idle offspring dreamed up new schemes to consume the excess energy. Boats were built....etc etc.

One of the ways that this complexity expressed itself was through the creation of private property. While it is by no means a law of nature that complexity requires private ownership (see Linux), it seems to have been the path of least resistance, information being most accessible inside one head or one tightly knit entity. From this point onwards, the excess energy expressed itself in a decrease in the entropy of not just the physical world but also human society. From the disordered tribal mass human society came to be some very few elites at the top and a large mass of workers below. This seems to be the inevitable form of affairs given inputs of energy.

This form of course feeds upon itself and expresses itself in colonialism, slavery and latterly the appropriation of oil resources from wherver they may be found. It is this cycle of energy, work, complexity and more energy that has governed the trajectory of human life since the birth of agriculture. The problem with socialism, communism, anarchy, etc. is not that they go against human nature - after all, greed and vileness do not encompass human nature as anyone who has met a human might know - but that they go against this inexorable process of increasing complexity with its attendant reduction of entropy in human political affairs.

Of course, these situations are untenable, being dependent as they are on continuously increasing inputs of energy. Dmitry Orlov's awesome book "Reinventing Collapse" pins the peaking of Russian oil production as one of the causes for the collapse of the Soviet Union (and the global peak for the impending collapse of the USA). These situations are also untenable because they push feedback loops farther and farther out, overriding the natural tendencies of adaptive systems with their energy inputs and delaying collapse until it becomes a catastrophic event.

The vectors through which energy organises society usually have one defining characteristic - they are conduits of information. Thus apart from the physical force of the king and his armies, the other two forms of political power came from information - religious information for the priestly class and market information for the merchant class. With the decline of the grip of the priestly class on useful information, religion has become less and less important in world affairs. The influence of the merchant class, on the other hand, has gone from strength to strength. 

The vector that the merchant class has used to transfer information and organise society is "money". Those bemoaning the loss of the gold standard do not understand that each of these vectors will try as hard as possible to gain as much share of the "information capacity" of society as possible. Thus money had to break free from the simplicity and rigidity of physical gold into more and more prevalent forms such as microchips and databases, and also into more and more complex forms such as CDOs et al.

Every increase in complexity is an increase in energy consumption and vice versa. This is the reason why "economic growth" has attained such importance. The complexity treadmill we are on is one that picks up speed exponentially. It is not possible to slow it down or to turn it off or even to have it run at the same pace. The feedback loops have been pushed so far out that it now takes increasing amounts of energy usage to keep collapse at bay. Therefore, any attempt at "green technology", "sustainable business" or other such eyewashes are doomed to fail, the only question being how awesome will the spectacle be.

Those who believe that microfinance is a great innovation of capitalism invariably turn out to be rich people, capitalists and those with a narrow world view of profitability as the ultimate good to be preserved at all costs. This imbecilic view is one that does horrifying violence to the natural world as well as to the aesthtic sense in human beings. What microfinance is, is the creeping of the organising vector of money into more and more remote regions. As the "developed world" is saturated with financial and transaction based ideas, this vector is seeking out greener pastures, so to speak. 

Those who say that microfinance companies should provide healthcare and education are missing the point and will continue to be surprised when microfinance companies continue to insist that their mandate is only to deal in the ultimately meaningless task of shifting some symbols from one nominal place to another, from one account to another and to use up their life force, burn energy and go to extreme lengths to put people into debt where none existed before.

Does microfinance pull people out of poverty? While the jury seems to be out on this one, let us try and see what the chances are. In a viallage economy, there are some people performing some tasks, all of whom have been given the status of "low value addition" by society at large. Even though they tend to the soil and water tables, and produce the food that is necessary for life, these economic activities somehow add less value than say the moving of symbols from one place to another, or the photographing of naked women. The toil, labour and sacrifice of the pople who feed and clothe the country is somehow of less value than Lalit Modi's partying and Vijay Mallaya's debauhery. Regardless, in this low value addition economy let us introduce some debt in a quantum that is only enough to serve some individual need. Because of the low investment, there is really no substantive change in the nature of the activities performed. Perhaps a sewing machine or a cow will be bought and used. This is certainly a benefit. But does anyone count the cost that now perhaps 30% of everyone's effort is being siphoned out of the local economy and is enriching some "social entrepreneur" or some banker somewhere? Indeed, in exchange for something as banal, as commonplace and as yes, vulgar, as a sewing machine or cow the village now loses 30% of its produce to the city. This is the vector of money and this is how it shapes society. Are we expecting this force to produce equality and prosperity? Expecting a villager to produce an ROI greater than Deutsche Bank - is that asking too much? Is our society so sick that we cannot even provide these simple tools to the rural populace to make their lives more human?

What is happening here is that the symbols of exchange are being loaned to people in echange for a staggering amount of rent. A huge amount of energy and effort is being expended so that some people will have something called a Rupee or a Taka or whatever, with which they can exchange their effort for the effort of others. The majority of this effort will be exchanged within the local economy, however, for the privilege of using these symbols a rent will be extracted. The burden of the rent, seen in the light of the limited utility of these symbols leads one to conclude that the monopoly on producing these symbols which lies with the state is nothing but a form of exploitation and opression. Those whose business it is to disseminate and collect these symbols, and worse, to employ the methods of coercion to recover these symbols are complicit in this oppression.

Now ask yourself, is microfinance a noble profession? Is it going to work? Or is it just another scheme to suck the life force of people and turn it into Ford Endeavours for the privileged?

Are there any solutions? Ah, but one. Anarchy.

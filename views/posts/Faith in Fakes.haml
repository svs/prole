So you go to a microfinance conference in Hyderabad and where do you stay?

Remember - everything is fake. The biggest fake is the internet. As an anarchist one keeps looking to Guttenberg's printing press and hoping that we will destroy the stranglehold of information but let us pause and see where Guttenberg's press got us - colonialism, slavery, the continued hold of religion, newspapers full of capitalist bile, television, the atom bomb - did it really change anything? Really? In four hundred years it has not brought us an inch closer to anything beautiful. And so with the internet. A beautiful illusion. The illusion of friendship and connectedness. The illusion of understanding. The illusion of knowledge. The illusion of political activity. It is all fake.

Web developers are just glorified printers. Without a fundamental change in the structure of human morality, human power relationships will continue to produce the same outcomes as always. Big pharma a corruption of the human intellect. Big finance a corruption of human enterprise. Big religion a corruption of the human yearning for spirutual connect with the universe. Media and internet a corruption of the human need to connect with each other. Universities a corruption of knowledge. The internet is only useful insofar as it can bring about the moral shift. Good luck with that, son of printing press.

When oh when will the lights go out?

h3. Observations on the process of becoming parents in the industrial age. 

The names have been changed to protect the innocent.

The effects of industrial society make themselves felt on the process of childbearing and parenting much before the actual process starts. Like everyone else, you have been swayed by the wonderfully modern concepts of "freedom" and "convenience" (and perhaps even a little bit of scorn for your old-fashioned parents) or even worse, a "career", and have put off having a child until the very last minute. Having made all the calculations, you and your spouse have decided that you can now afford a child. It still of course depends on the stock market but hey, no one's getting any younger. Your biological clocks are ticking. Fresh with the optimism from this decision, you and your spouse embark on the most pleasurable activity of baby making. At last, not-so-young man, you can claim that elusive erotic privilege of ejaculating inside your wife, instead of in a plastic bag. You start. Taking out time and energy and enthusiasm for the act of lovemaking from the stresses of your daily lives, you start coupling with increased intensity. If you are lucky, it can work quite well. The shared mission brings you closer to your spouse and your marriage seems solid, your home a good one to bring a child into. However, if you are unlucky, and it seems "an increasing number are":http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/102985/India/infertility-on-the-rise.html, then give thanks for all the other wonderful things that industrial society has kept in store for you.

To begin with, the mother-to-be finds that her body still inhabits an age when childbearing happened much sooner and by the mid-to-late thirties is now rife with fibroids or cysts or her tubes are malfunctioning or any number of such complications brought about by the passage of time, time spent in the pursuit of "freedom", which in most cases might well have meant the freedom to work long hours and spend ones free time drunk in loud clubs or on the Internet. In any case, the first industrial intervention is necessitated here. Trips to the fertility clining, masturbation in a cup, painful needles poked up the vagina, dyes forced through the tubes and any number of other invasions of the body and the spirit and that is just the beginning. The act of love, performed so casually and unthinkingly in the millenia of human existence is now reduced to clock-watching and the rubbing of bodies at predetermined times and places. Ovulation times are determined. Meetings are scheduled around "doing it". If work takes you out of town, get ready for all the recriminations attendant with prolonging this torture for another month. Careful attention is paid to each drop of semen, more valuable than gold. But not to worry, after extensive tests the problem is diagnosed.

Once the problem is diagnosed, it is time for the treatment. If you are lucky it is something small which only takes a week to recover from. Advances in industrial medicine mean that only small cuts are necessitated. A camera is inserted into you and a skilled doctor removes the offending obstruction. Later, you can even watch a video of it with the helpful attendant augmenting your vocabulary with words like "laparoscopic", "fundus", etc. which you can toss around casually at cocktail parties if so inclined. A lakh plus is nothing. After all, you don't have much time. What good is the money if not for this, etc. etc. Eventually, after some more rubbing and clock-watching, the HCG report comes back and is within the pregnant range. Ecstasy! and then rapidly uncertainty and fear. You know this cousin's friend conceived at 36 and she had a miscarriage. My neighbour's wife has had two. Quick - to the Internet. Google - miscarriage rates in older mothers. Oh my God! 2% of people miscarry. Baby, that's nothing. It's not nothing. And so on.

The overriding emotion during the rest of the pregnancy is quite stark in its simplicity - fear. Living as we do in nuclear families, the couple is essentially left to stew in their own anxieties. There is nobody there to assuage the fears. The older generation in any case feels perhaps vindicated in this situation. After all, they had been telling you all along to "do things at the right time". Their advice now comes loaded always with the almost indistinguishable smirk of "didn't we tell you so?". There are still some doctors left who go out of their way to calm the expectant couple and make their life easier, however one suspects that they are in the minority. After all, industrial medicine is a for-profit venture and there is no juicier mark than an older, affluent urban couple with a precious foetus. Game on! The couple, having been "educated" in the system, has already all the faith in "modern technology" and welcome the reassuring, if cold, embrace of modern medicine.

So, ultrasounds every two weeks, 6 week dating scan, 12 week anomaly scan, amniocentesis - the list of interventions is laid out and well known. The risks are carefully delineated - 1 in 465 women of your profile have a Downs syndrome baby and there is a 2% chance of miscarriage from amniocentesis. Choose! Of course, there is no choice. Capitalism is survival of the fittest. Industrial society has no place for idiots. Is there space in our careers for a spastic baby? When you get old, who will look after you? A mongoloid? But what if we miscarry? We can't go through this again. sweetheart, we can always adopt, but a Downs syndrome baby would be a catastrophic outcome. Come come, everything will be alright. At the 6 week dating scan a very serious looking ultrasonologist in front of a very serious machine - 4d echo Doppler scan - looks intently at the inside of the uterus and proclaims seriously - subseptate. Google - 2/3 chance of miscarriage. Stay in bed, the doctor advises, on your left side. Helpless, the mother lies stewing in her anxiety, laptop open to the various websites - worry, don't worry. Worry. The good news is that the results came back from the amniocentesis - there's only now a 0.5% chance of Downs syndrome.

At around this time, the pretty young girls in the doctor's waiting room start approaching you. Would you like to store your baby's umbilical cord blood? It can be used to cure a number of diseases later (a lie). We will store it for 21 years. Spinal cord injuries? Why, yes sir, they can e cured (a lie). These are stem cells. They can cure anything (another lie). Of course, the unspoken undertone is that only a stingy bastard would deny his baby access to these wonderful life saving technologies. What is 70,000 bucks? We even have an installment plan. Asking the doctor yields this - if you can afford it, go for it. But we heard it is banned in Europe? Roll of the eyes. You see, some of these business type families, you know uneducated, they don't go for it. Most couples like you....

When all else fails, there is IUGR - the Intra Uterine Growth Restriction. Just a foetus and the baby is already being measured against a "norm". Measurement is of course the cornerstone of the industrial method. Where this "norm" has come from is never revealed. What was the sample size, where was the sample taken from, are the actuarial tables from the US, have the machines been re-calibrated for India? Why answer these questions? A badly calibrated machine brings more revenue. Do you dare to question the wisdom of GE? Now that the baby is "performing poorly", it is time for more scans. And oh, don't forget the supplements.

As usual, the industrial method is providing, in its own way, answers to problems created by itself. The quality of those answers is poor, but the way they are delivered is so dazzling, those shiny chrome implements, those rounded plastic buttons, those screens and readouts, those scientific sounding words on paper, the backing of multinational corporations - GE, Pfizer, Novartis....No one notices the ill effects of the industrial lifestyle, the lack of healthy and natural lifestyle options, the stress, the constant cocooning of the body for protection from the city, the lack of traditional support systems along with the death of traditional knowledge and the loss of control over ones own well-being and the crushing of the spirit under the machine-precision of modern science, most of which is as it turns out, totally fallible.

In the end it turns out that there is no septum in the uterus, the misdiagnosis and subsequent confinement to the bed did more harm than good, the recovery from the unnecessary Cesarean operation was much more difficult, compounded by the atrophied musculature. The cost associated with these misdiagnoses of course get counted as in increase in GDP. A simple home birth with a midwife and some boiling water wouldn't count you see. C'mon young mother, take a scar across your midriff for the stock market.

Does this end with the birth of that little bundle of joy? That mewling infant that has been birthed under the cyclops glare of an operating theater lamp, amongst the cold steel of a modern birthing "facility"? Far from it, it is indeed just beginning. Characteristically, there is no one now to provide guidance as to nursing. In this entire process, the one thing that requires some knowledge i.e. the nursing process, a proper latch for the infant, etc. is completely disregarded. Then, when the baby loses some weight he gets sent to the NICU. Far be it from anyone to mention that all babies lose weight in the first few days. When a 6 pound baby becomes a 5.5 pound baby, he gets sent to the Neonatal intensive care unit where doctors stare at him gravely and monitor his charts and his temperature. 

The new parents are never given time to enjoy this wonderful moment. The newborn screening tests are in and the IRT is slightly elevated. The paediatrician suspects cystic fibrosis. Before investigating the nursing, before taking some time to allow the baby to start gaining weight, before everything he suggests that the baby might have the cruel wasting disease that will see him dead by 20 and which the probability of him having is so vanishingly small as to be non-existent. Of course, the new parents are still not completely disillusioned with the industrial process and so spend more time worrying. The doctor has of course prescribed more tests. 

And so it goes. Weighing, measuring, supplementing - this is what passes for parenting in the industrial world. While he is an infant, he will be measured against some charts for height, weight and head circumference. Later, he will be graded against his ability to regurgitate a state mandated syllabus. Afterwards, he will be judged not only by the size of his bank account but by the conspicuous consumption he indulges in and by the banal conformity of his ideas.

For a detailed analysis of the ills of industrialization, do read "Ivan Illich":http://www.davidtinapple.com/illich/. If you enjoyed this post, you might enjoy Illich's seminal "Medical Nemesis":http://www.davidtinapple.com/illich/nemesis.html. Illich of course has some dazzling insights not just into the industrial institutions of our time but into what it means to be human amongst the machines. With industrial institutions, the medium is the message and this is something that I found very interesting to ponder.

Sorry there's nothing about AntiRetrovirals here (ART), but I couldn't pass up the chance to play upon the title of "Walter Benjamin's seminal work":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction

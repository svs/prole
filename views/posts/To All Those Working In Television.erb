h1. ...please quit it.

You are ruining this country. What, you don't believe me? Eh? Spell it out like for a child? Okay. Here.

A cursory glance at television is enough to reassure one that Indian television is replete with images of feminine oppression, superstition, the glorification of excess wealth and patriarchy. A random glance at the TV produced this - 


Women, submissive creatures who must please the Lord of the house who has important things to do outside while the "janaanis" work the kitchen and take care of hearth and home, their petty intrigues making up the bulk of what passes for a storyline. A child bride, oh look how cute. Images of patriarchy and medieval thinking such as these abound on our airwaves. Infact, there is little else. The "religious" channels advocate more superstition, more blind faith and more acceptance of social orders and mores that in a more civilized society would rightly be condemned as barbaric. the news channels pass of evidence of Hanuman, a giant wish-fulfilling Golden Fish and aliens on Earth. Oh look there, the brave Johar of Rani Padmini - a pure Hindu queen forced to commit suicide by the marauding Muslims. What effect does a constant barrage of such images have on society. What do people without a feminist sensitivity take away from these images? Does my father in law feel more comfortable oppressing his wife because he knows that everyone does it? What will you do when your nine year old comes home from school and says she got married? Do we really need images like these? 

There are a number of arguments that are put up by TV professionals in their own defence. Let us see:

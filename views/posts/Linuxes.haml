Actually this is a post on the ongoing quest for minimal perfection but since Linux is my office and my home, much of this pursuit is carried out through it as a medium. For the minimalist, there is no better distro than "Arch Linux":http://archlinux.org. However, setting up an Arch Linux box is quite a lot of work. Automount, policykit, suspend-resume - all of these have to be installed and configured by hand. The rewards, however, are tremondous. A fast, stable system that looks mean! It boots up in text mode and you have to start the window manager by hand - hard core. The gritty feel of Arch Linux almost invites you to try out some techno wallpapers for "splashy":http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Splashy and "SLIM":http://www.google.com/url?q=http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SLiM&ei=MqCaS5_eG8mwrAeh35WOAw&sa=X&oi=nshc&resnum=1&ct=result&cd=1&ved=0CAoQzgQoAA&usg=AFQjCNHmpOHii9uFmpCSAM2bJ_gqgDKg1Q.

Another thing that is very easy in Arch Linux is choosing window managers and any self-respecting geek is eventually drawn to the minimal wonder that are tiling window managers and "Xmonad":http://xmonad.org, one of their most elegant manifestations. I used Xmonad extensively a few years ago on Arch Linux. It had a "Dark Knight wallpaper":http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yrBR70igJOs/SIHhEaYXIJI/AAAAAAAAAHM/p2M_Z_ycq80/s1600/The_Dark_Knight_Wallpaper_.jpg and Monaco font in purple in the terminals. And then one day, failure to mount a USB drive at a friend's house meant that I could no longer brag about how cool Linux was and in a pique, I moved to Ubuntu. I am currently on Ubuntu, and very happy with Karmic Koala. It handles my bluetooth headset perfectly, pulseaudio is impeccably set up, etc. etc. Gnome is a functional and modern desktop. I have all my keyboard shortcuts down and rarely need to use the mouse, much like in Xmonad. And yet, something seemed missing. I had traded my elegance for functionality, and that was something I have recently been feeling more and more.

Today, I found the best of both worlds. "Xmonad instead of compiz inside gnome":http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Using_xmonad_in_Gnome. All the goodness of gnome-panel, all the joy of Xmonad. And with "tilda":http://tilda.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page, I never have to remember which desktop my terminal is on.

Sweet.

This one is going to be nice. After the "great big zero":http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html?_r=2 that was the 00s, we find ourself at the threshold of a momentous decade. This is the decade where the proletarian voice finally gets heard in all its confusing babble, and a true consensus on the future of the planet will arise out of the tower of babel that is the competing conversations of humankind in the 21st century.

A political system will arise that is more resembling natural "adaptive systems":http://theautomaticearth.blogspot.com/2010/01/january-1-2010-fractal-adaptive-cycles.html with balance, sustainability, beauty and other such exalted notions as its cornerstones. Technology will make this possible. The world will rediscover and reinvent socialism and anarchy into a wonderful hybrid - "Panarchy":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panarchy, along with open source government mechanisms which will soon wash away the blight of corruption, unequal power distribution and the overwhelming voice of corporate and capital power which dominates the airwaves today. The traditional structures are not so much under attack as being rendered obsolete, antiquated and unfit for the new world. It is a time of great promise and optimism for the future.

There are exciting efforts afoot. None of them make a direct and revolutionary assault on the ramparts of the state but that is going to be the nature of the revolution - quiet, unassuming, unstoppable. Sites like "My football Club":http://www.myfootballclub.co.uk/ and "Slice the Pie":http://www.slicethepie.com/ are the first voices in an inexorable movement towards proletarian rule. The revolution has never been so pure, so close and so tantalising as at this time. 

Adding my voice to these conversations about who should rule and how this rule is to be exercised, I would like to humbly present "rbus.in":http://rbus.in, a starting point for bringing about a panarchic public transport system in this blighted city we call home - Mumbai. Rbus is open source, so feel free to start one in your city by forking it from its "github repository":http://github.com/svs/rbus

However, the way forward is not without its dangers. The traditional power structures are no strangers to the use of massive propaganda and violence to achieve their ends. When their propaganda starts failing, they will increase the intensity of their violence. The police state or military dictatorship (so beloved of some rightwingers in our nation) lurk on the horizon as dark possibilities, and the only thing that will keep them at bay is the shining light of information that is free. The most basic imperative of a proletarian today is to keep the lights on and the network up. The network is the basis of the peaceful revolution and protecting it is everyone's responsibility. The best way to protect the network is to use software that is free and accessibile to all. Do consider switching from your Windows or Mac machine to a Linux box. The new "Ubuntu":http://ubuntu.com, Fedora or "Mandriva 2010":http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/mandriva-2010.html are quite good choices to get started. Your digital freedoms are the basis on which you will operate in the new world. 

Money will disappear. Both of money's traditional roles as a medium of exchange and as a store of value are essentially forms of information storage. If this information can be stored in other places, such as in the community memory or in some database somewhere, then whether the Central Banks of the world like it or not, the monopoly on systems that aid exchange and store value is over and with it will end the edifice of the whole financial system -- of that "giant squid wrapped around the face of humanity" -- and all the unproductive activity that funnels power and pelf away from where it is created and into offices and boardrooms for a select few. The network will allow the cooperative management of more and more of the world's assets and will remove them from market mandated solutions. Things like education, healthcare, public transportation, arts and culture, environmental management and a whole host of other critical issues will be taken out of the sphere of the market and into the sphere of the commons, where they rightfully belong. Those enamoured of the new innovations of capitalism such as microfinance and affordable private schools will find that they have been mistaking capitalism's last, desperate and doomed attempt at credibility as its greatest success. 

I have nothing but optimism for the future. I do hope we can all work together to make this decade one worth remembering for all the right reasons.

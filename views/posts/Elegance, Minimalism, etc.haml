Of late, I've been wondering if minimalism, atleast the way it is practiced on the web, is worth it and whether it is a viable philosophy. If you look at any of the minimalist web design listings, you'll basically see a plethora of sites in black and white. Why? Is minimalism condemned to be ugly and boring? Or is there something the matter with ones interpretation of the word? 

For me, minimalism is essentially a formal concept, not a functional one. It's more about the form of an action than the results of the action. Happiness does not lie in reducing activity, it lies in mindful and fulfilling activity. Thus minimalism of the sort which limits ones ability to do anything -- in web design terms, to be usable and unique -- is not appealing to me. I cannot eschew the use of color just to fulfill some minimalist fantasy. Minimalism as a life philosophy is a self contradictory philosophy, and is a half-baked yearning for something else. The end point of minimalism per se is death - no more need for anything. At each point along this route, there is a further point you can go to. Have you given up color in your websites? Good. Now give up your websites. I have no problem with people choosing the hermetic way, but it seems a little stupid to be stranded halfway down the path to nothing, constantly justifying everything against an ethic that is contradictory with itself and perhaps even opposed to life.

My personal preference has changed from a quest for minimalism to a quest for elegance. The quest for elegance encompasses much of the quest for minimalism but is free from the pitfalls of the latter because elegance is a functional, not formal construct. Elegance is also free to break from the monasticity of minimalism and thus is not hemmed in by those internal contradictions. Taking things away does not always make them more elegant. Some mindfulness is required in these matters, and blindly eschewing jQuery or AJAX is akin to making a hut withut a roof. Might work fine in some cases, but surely not everytime. And if you're building a hut, you might as well put in a roof because otherwise why build a hut at all?

In the end, elegance leaves one with choices. Minimalism, not so much. My own frustrations with minimalism for its own sake began with a recent attempt to reinstall Arch Linux. I wanted a bare Linux that runs fast, has no flash or gloss and is rough and tough and rock steady. A quick download later, looking at the login screen for Arch Linux, I was overcome by a wave of ennui. Building an Arch Linux system is a daunting task, one that takes several days of concentrated effort and even then it might never work properly. Why? I asked myself, must I go through this? In a flash the answer came to me - the minimalist way would be to not waste, and so not wasting my time would be minimalism. Though not quite, right? After all, minimalism isn't about saving time or being happy. Minimalism is about doing with less. Elegance on the other hand is doing more with less. Doing things well. Making it look easy. I tossed my Arch Linux install disk out of the window and was happy. Replacing unthinking minimalism with a mindful elegance as my guiding construct has solved many of my problems. I can now use Ubuntu and Gnome for their beauty and run XMonad inside Gnome for its elegance. I can blog on tumblr.com instead of writing my own blog engine in 40 lines or less of ruby (I can, but I don't. I actually prefer writing and publishing from emacs)

So, I can now redesign the blog, add some more colors to make the site more beautiful and also more user-friendly and I can do all this with a clean conscience. The goal of life is to be happy, not to do without. The whole reason to do without stuff is because it gets in the way of being happy. For some people, and for me, being happy involves free time and the sun on my arms, the outdoors, travel, flying and programming and my family. I don't really need anything else. Infact, most other things just get in the way. But not colors on my web page. Not jQuery. Not CSS3. Let's be realistic.

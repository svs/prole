So you just got your fancy new iPhone, Blackberry or Android device? You're loving the capacitive touchscreens, the haptic feedback, the accelerometer? You're impressed by the millions of "apps" out there? You feel comforted by being connected to everything, warm in the constant stream of information? Do you feel connected to your friends? Very good. You're dying and your smartphone is killing you softly.

*Connection*
Call me old fashioned, but connection means a completely different thing to me. Don't believe me? ask yourself a question - what percentage of your facebook friends will come down to the cop house at 3 a.m. to bail you out when you've done something incredibly stupid? How many of them can you ask to borrow their car? Yeah, there's your new-fangled connection right there. When you are sick, how many of them will nurse you back to health? Take care of your responsiilites when you heal? Come to your wedding, your son's marriage or your funeral?  What the Internet provides, and the smartphone makes ubiquitous, is the illusion of connection. You are happy to ignore the living, breathing phenomenon of a human being infront of you to type away at your touchscreen.

And what of connection to the world at large? Today, using well crafted twitter, facebook and rss technologies, one can be on top of all the news. How much it snowed in Tennessee today, how much the price of gold was, what new things happened in the world. In order to succeed, one must have information. True? Well, not really. If you take a long hard look at all the information you consume versus the information that is actually helpful to you in real life, you will come to the inescapable conclusion that you are suffering from information malnutrition. If your diet contained 90% crap for every 10% of nutrition, you would say that you were eating mostly crap. It's the same with information. And just like that 90% of crap puts a strain on your digestive system, the superfluous information you consume has a lasting and pernicious effect on your psyche. For one, the medium is increasingly becoming the message. Constant distraction leads to the inability to focus. Those of you who are my age might even look back wistfully to that old relic - boredom. That boredom which we used to hate so much but which allowed our minds to wander, to make unexpected connections, that allowed you to be yourself.

The ancients have spoken at length about the benefits of meditation. It is the time without thoughts when your essence can communicate with your physical form directly, without intermediation or distraction. As the Buddha said, "We become what we think" and this daily exercise of connecting to  your essential nature is the bedrock of good health. This connection has been broken by your cellphone. When you were bored on the bus or the taxi, when you were looking at the shop windows while waiting for a friend or pacing up and down at bus stops, you were in effect meditating. Now, instead of this opportunity to connect with yourself you can spend your time with your head immersed in some sordid tales of global warming or political intrigue, illegal war or impending economic, ecological and societal collapse. Does this mess with your mind? I can bet it does.

Forget about the inward connection, even our outward connections have atrophied. Like mindless bozos, we now see the world through our Layar (tm)s or our google goggles. We cannot even now look around ourselves without the machine. We cannot find any place without the machine. We cannot move without the machine. Are we getting better? And this is when we do look around at all. most of the times, we are in one place physically and in entirely another place mentally, reading or viewing about something happening miles away, to someone else and forgetting entirely who we are and where we are. Then we go home and have to look up the location of the neighbourhood print shop or doctor.

*Illusion*
So your smartphone is smart. What does that make you, Dumbuser? The ancients have spoken at length about the concept of maya, of samsara, of this worldly illusion. We have gone one step further and choose to live in an illusion within an illusion. We have the illusion of friendship and connectedness through our social networks. We have the illusion of political activity through reading and sharing articles and sending petitions, we have the illusion of intellect when all we have is a bunch of data. And we do not have even the illusion of a spiritual consciousness, an illusion of a way of being that would lead to a better world. No, the better world comes about through making the illusion more real. When you can pass your whole day without sensory input from around you, when you can have the most realistic simulation of sex with strangers, when you can have voyeurism in 3d, when you can communicate with other humans through a series of well formatted protocols the way machines do, then the world will be better. The answers all lie in more network intermediation, better data schemas, more searchable everything.

When you no longer look around you, you no longer belong even where you are. Every place is just another place to login from. Just meatspace. Real life is in the network.

*Explosions*
Are you a compassionate human being?  Do you know where your rare earths are mined? Do you know where your phones are made? Under what conditions? You perhaps do not care about the skyscrapers of factory farmed chickens or the cows knee deep in their own shit for your eating pleasure, but do you care about the communities of men who spend their waking lives underground so you can have your smartphone? Oh, I get it. There isn't an app for compassion. Your smartphone is an ecological and human killer and it is tainting your karma. the millions and millions of phones sold daily across the world are all complicit in the rape of our mother Earth. Tomorrow, if we find a deposit of some other element which makes them run a bit faster, we will strip the Earth, remove those pesky forests and dig, scrape and burrow into her so that your twitter feeds can load a bit faster, or so that you can be dazzled with some zooming effects and sexy colors. Or maybe you need a faster model so you can get finally get laid.

*Logout*
One day, you will feel awkward asking your neighbour for a favour. This is disconnection. You will not be able to have a conversation with the colleague in the next cubicle. This is disconnection. You will sit down for a meal with your parents but you will read someone's blog. You will meet friends for coffee and be on the phone with someone who is elsewhere. You will be playing with your child but checking email on your smartphone. This is disconnection. Then one day you are sick, dying and your phone beeps. It's your children. they cannot be with you in your last hours, but atleast they sent an email. 

You are already dying and your smartphone is killing you.

Save yourself.

logout.

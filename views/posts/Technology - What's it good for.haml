Frankly, I never thought that I would be asking this question. Having been an ardent advocate of technological progress, logical thinking and rationality in all spheres of life, this thought caught me by surprise, coming as it were not from some book (or web page) but completely unbidden one afternoon as I held my three week old son in my hands. The old questions arose again - what, exactly, has the human race gained from technology and what has it lost? It becomes increasingly clear that what technology has allowed humans to do is to control their environment to such a degree that instead of having to collapse separately, the human race can now collapse all together as it runs up against hard limits that are in no way negotiable including peak oil, peak soil and peak water.

Does 21st century man really live better than at any other time? He lives longer but is his life any better? Fed on a steady diet of high fructose corn syrup he is prone to obesity and immunological disorders, diabetes and a host of other issues. Raised on a steady diet of TV infomercials and late night sales shows his view of the world is completely bounded by the transaction based economy, his sense of community rapidly dwindling to nothing. This brain of his craves shiny things like iPods and what not which hold him in a thrall which is beyond imbecility - some smoothly animated SVG icons lead these people to egg on the mining operations far away, in someone's home. His social, economic and political structures do not include him except to suck out his life force through taxation and the periodic charade of voting. Theoretically he is free.

These shiny objects have also allowed the geeks to speak with a sense of moral superiority - we're building a new world you can hear them say. A connected world, one where information os free. And alas, that old problem - what of humankind's moral compass? Who is tending that? Your logic has destroyed our myths but it is not obvious that man can live by information alone. Without the binding force of mythology man is alone - a lone actor with no higher purpose, capable of nothing, susceptible to all the latest fads and impulses. He is today volatile and footloose. The technology that has enabled the construction of those giant steel teeth that bite the earth, those giant probes that thrust into her seeking, those whirring, buzzing, screaming gears that strip her naked is the same technology that has brought us to the ecological event horizon - cleared forests, islands of plastic, huge open pit mines leaking their cyanide tailings into the wild - disaster after disaster after disaster. Those that live quietly in the forest now have to move and be part of the great global dream of unlimited and instant consumption for all unless of course you are at the bottom of the pack in which case its one step forward and two steps back. Palliatives are offered for sure, but note that the fault is never one of the system. Vast injustices are the order of the day and yet it is never the system that is broken. More technology will fix it. That and overcoming one's personal failings, laziness and stupidity - after all, Dhirubhai did it.

In the absence of the spiritual revolution, all will be lost. We don't need more technology. We don't need more monoculture fields and depleted topsoil. We don't need more consumption and haphazard disposal of metals and plastics to sustain you in your perpetual boredom, in your complete disconnect from society. We don't need more fighter drones, capable of taking out "enemies" in the night from afar. We don't need more electricity so that even more people can consume this ludicrous farce that is television. We have enough technology and yet the vast majority of the people on this planet do not even have anything resembling a life. Thousands of years of technological evolution but our capacity for expressing our compassion and for building a beautiful planet has not increased one jot. You say we have better drugs but only for the rich and mostly to cure their industrial diseases. Infant mortality is down but we are now 9 billion and staring species collapse in the face. Messages travel around the world in seconds, but there is no one to talk to and nothing to say. 140 characters is all we need these days. It's all we can deal with.

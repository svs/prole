Anyone who cares to look can easily appreciate that the education system in India is completely broken. For every one Pentium chip designer, there are thousands upon thousands of unrealised scientists, artists and intellectuals. The crisis manifests itself at all levels - from the lack of availability of schools and teachers at the primary level, to the horrific state syllabi still stuck in an age when access to information was a problem, to the crippled skillsets of our graduates to the stark choices between science, arts and commerce as though a businessman would not benefit from knowing logic, or a philosopher has no need for computers. I hold myself up as a shining example of the abject failure of this sytem. I, lover of computers and all things logical, forced into failing Maths by my teachers, forced into a useless accounting and business degree simply because the choices are so stark, and here and now at age 34 rediscovering my love for everything school taught me to fear. Fellow proletarians, we are the only one's who can change this system and as we stand at the brink of the information explosion, we need urgently to overhaul this education system with something more appropriate, something for the modern age. What would such a school look like? We don't know for sure, but we have a starting point - the impartation of literacy. Let us see.

Myself and my co-conspirator Sameer Pawar came up with a rough draft one night outside Konkan Swad after some beers and a phenomenal fish meal. The starting point of our explorations in a new system of education is not really a new school but something better described as a literacy center. In this country with so many illiterate people you would imagine that something would be done by the government like this, that they might squeeze in a channel's worth of educational programming in between the hundreds of retrograde channels they tolerate but they steadfastedly refuse to make even these token efforts. Why? you might ask. The answer is as obvious as it is odious - they don't give a shit about you.

Anyways, on with the plan. As the title of this post suggests, it is a place open to EVERYBODY regardless af age, sex, creed, color, sexual orientation, race, etc. can come to learn to read, 'rite and 'rithmetise. The basic medium of instruction will be through computers, with a facilitator present to guide the students. The reason for this is that while it is very difficult to train thousands of teachers and maintain lesson quality, it is exponentially easier to train a few thousand facilitators to guide students in the use of their learning machines. Lessons will be available all day, facilitators will be available as per a predetermined schedule. Computers will be sourced from the corporate world as well as donors who will give us their tired, their hungry, their poor computers. Said computers will be rejuvenated with Linux, loaded with educational programs and sent out into the world. Venues will come again from kind donors, or perhaps schools. It might even be possible to gift a school with a computer lab in exchange for a classroom. Industrial waste recycling - check. Municipal school computer labs - check. Literacy for all - check. what more do you want? A website that will stream the lessons on demand? Check.

All the lessons will be open licensed, so that the wonderful gift of literacy is not sullied by patent and copyright restrictions. TV channels and radio stations will be free to rebroadcast the lessons. Anyone can set up a school along these lines. Adherence to the principles of the system will earn accredition under a brand name. There will be no exams except for more advanced classes, where a demonstration of basic concepts will be required in order to smoothen class interactions with the facilitator.

The syllabus will initially be restricted to the 3Rs. Incidental development of the world's best methodologies for imparting literacy will be an added bonus.

That's it. Simple no?

h3. On economic achievement, or lack thereof.

I'm going to illustrate the concept with a rather graphic analogy. Those easily offended, please move on elsewhere while the adults are speaking. Anyways, let's say you live with your mother and of late, you've been noticing some bruising here and there as you have your reakfast together as you do every morning before you leave for your job of pulling levers down at the local factory. You don't give it much thought, thinking she's probably got it under control. I mean she has her right to privacy and you know, what she does is really her own business and she would have mentioned it if it were a real problem. Over time, the bruises become more and more prominent but you still say nothing. Jobs are tight now, and mentioning the bruises might lead to some hospital bills which you can ill afford in these times of economic uncertainty. You decide to ignore the issue and you busy yourself pulling and pushing levers with renewed vigour, hoping for a promotion of some sort so you can finally "do something" about her situation. One day she turns up at breakfast with a huge black eye and a broken arm. This is getting intolerable. You will do something about it this very weekend.

That afternoon, you come home early and you hear loud sounds, screaming, banging, hollering coming from mom's bedroom. You enter and you find there Tony Hayward and Ben Bernanke double penetrating your mom as "Hugh Grant":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant_%28manager%29 (no, not the actor) stuffs his cock in her mouth. A dwarf who looks like Barack Obama is flogging her with a barbed wire whip. With horror, you realise that the levers you have been pushing all your life are attached to a prosthetic tongue which is tickling Tony Hayward's anus, making him go faster.

Now, knowing this, do you go back the next day to pulling levers at the factory? The Earth is your mother. Those of us who have been pushing these levers most enthusiastically for the pleasure of our captains of industry have contributed the most to the rape of our mother. If you work in either of banking and international finance, the media, the armaments industry, politics, big pharma, big agri, big oil, or if you consume their products wantonly to satisfy some commodity fetish, then you are complicit. We are all complicit but don't be fooled - some went willingly, hoping they'd be next after Tony was done.

Economic achievement in this system amounts to a hand in the rape and destruction of the Earth, the enslavement and eliminitaion of tribes and peoples and cultures, wars, the systematic reduction of humans into either "savages" or machines and nature into "commodities". Some might say that this is progress. I say that your logic has defeated me. This must be progress. Enjoy your Deepwater Horizon folks. I hope it blots out your miserable little lives.

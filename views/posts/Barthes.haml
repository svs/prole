I'm currently immersed in the "Roland Barthes":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes Reader, a collection of writings by the French philosopher and semiotician. I've only read a few of the pieces and they are amazing. While I will not attempt to write a review of the pieces or add my comments to Barthes' work, I do want to say that if you enjoy reading Umberto Eco's essays and non-fiction pieces, do try Barthes. He is dazzlingly bright and while complex, never hides behind undefined terms or obfuscated language. His insights into myths and bourgeois propaganda are eye-opening to the student of society.

It was Freud who said - and was reprised by Tyler Durden - that 'soap is the yardstick of a civilisation'. I have some recent evidence that this just might be true.

Civilisation it seems consisting of increasing ones private property by creating a need where none exists, creating the solution to this need (even better if this solution creates the need for its own continued use) and exploiting the maximum number of people in the process. For example the entire fashion industry works on just such whimsy of rich people, created by the relentless parading of images designed to cause desire which is fulfilled by adolescent Vietnamese girls in sweatshops. 

Many years ago, a hippie told me that one of the best examples of a product like this was shampoo. All hair needed, he said, was the occasional touch of soap. "Keep them short, keep them clean and you'll be fine." Taking his advice, I stopped using shampoo, even though I'd been plagued all my life by a recurrent dandruff problem. Out trekking, no shower for 2 days, dandruff. Run out of shampoo, too busy to buy, two days pass, dandruff. Said hippie had warned me that the transition would be traumatic and that I needed to find a secluded place to perform this act in. The little commune in Panchgani was full of smelly hippies anyway, so I wasted no time starting. For a week or so, my scalp went nuts. I thought my whole head would flake away and die. I entertained the idea that I had been taken for a ride by my friend Richard, but the evidence was there. Another hippie there had these wonderful dreadlocks and when I asked him what was to be done to get them he replied - nothing. Nothing? Not a damn thing. Just don't allow any soap or water to get anywhere near your hair and pretty soon you'll have dreads. They didn't smell or nothing either. So, I persisted and a few days later - all quiet topside. No itching. No dandruff. Nada. I was shampoo free. I fell down laughing. Lather, rinse, repeat? What a fucking joke. Now i know why they call it conditioner. It conditions your scalp to keep needing more...

I wonder what it was that prevented me from going whole hog that time, but it wasn't until about ten days ago that "this post":http://aadivaahan.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/snake-eyes/ gave me the idea to quit soap entirely. It's been over two weeks now and the wife hasn't even noticed any change. The scalp, conditioned to the soap, is going through the same withdrawal symptoms, but I've seen this movie before. It's going to be fine.

Soap is, of course, the spreader of civilisation. We have all seen what civilisation is - the manufacture of useless products to amass property, the exaltation of the artificial over the natural and the creation of an "other", always, against which to measure refinement and modernity.

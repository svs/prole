h3. Should we increase agricultural production?

!{float:left}/images/green-revolution.jpg! India has some of the "worst malnutrition rates in the world":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition_in_India. Increasing food production seems to be the obvious answer to the problem of malnutrition. With the Green Revolution hitting the limits of fertlizer abuse, groundwater abuse and soil fertility depletion, we need another technological breakthrough to deliver increased yields to feed our burgeoning population. Biotechnology in general and genetically modified crops in particular might help us increase yields by resisting pests and growing in marginal soils. Interlinking of rivers will bring irrigation to the 60% of Indian farm land that has no irrigation. To the city dweller and perhaps the beareaucrat, these things seem obvious. But wait...

Wait - didn't we already have a Green Revolution? So why do we have worse malnutrition now than sub-Saharan Africa? Ah, that's right - the population grew faster than food output. So the increased food production didn't go into making the population better nourished, it simply created a bigger population? How could that happen? So after the GR and the thousands upon thousands of water pumps in the Punjab pumping out yellow water, "fouled by pesticide":http://www.google.com/search?q=punjab+pesticide and a farm population suffering "skyrocketing rates of cancer":http://thelangarhall.com/punjab/leaving-punjab-on-the-cancer-train/, after the "depleted groundwater tables":http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=north+india+ground+water we have gone from a country of starving people to a country of starving people and a small minority of "overnourished":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition_in_India#Overnutrition people, suffering from developed world diseases like diabetes, obesity, etc? Was this what we wanted from the Green Revolution?

There are several aspects to the problem which bear elaboration. The first one is the problem of structure. In short, if you feed a cow meat, it doesn't turn into a lion. It simply goes mad.

Mirzapur district is one of the poorest districts in India. Can you imagine what Mirzapur district looks like? Is it a barren scrub where nothing grows, like those images from the Chambal or Beed regions? Imagine my surprise upon arriving there to find hectare upon hectare of lush green rice fields till the horizon? Why is Mirzapur poor? I asked my ex-boss, a renowned _social entrepreneur_. His answer, as shocking as it may seem, was as follows - "the land is too fertile. people get lazy because they don't need to work." When prodded, he concedes that the upper caste Bhumihars who comprise about 7% of the population own about 90% of the land. While some sources on the internet differ, the people told me that the district was well irrigated and agricultural productivity was high. The widespread poverty was then solely because of redistributive issues. Will incresing food production solve this issue? Food production doesn't really seem to be the low hanging fruit when it comes to reducing malnutrition. It seems instead that land redistribution would do a lot more for food security and to bring about a general if low-level prosperity  in India. In the absence of putting meaningful economic capability into the hands of the general populace, all increases in production will continue to enrich the few. We will be exporting fruit while our own people starve. We will pit the nourishment and wellbeing of the marginal farmer and the marginal consumer against the commodity futures traders and say "survival of the fittest".

The trend, as might be expected from the current setup, seems to be in the opposite direction with the large corporations buying up large tracts to do industrial agriculture. "Increased efficiency makes everyone richer", comes the cry from the Treasury benches. Wait a second - the farmer who had his little piece of land and no doubt had to work very hard to feed himself and his family now has to work as a corporate cog with a uniform, a timesheet and minimum wage? I don't know if this is the kind of trickle down that really makes people better off. From being an autonomous agent in an ecosystem, he is now a cog in the wheel of an entity large enough to do serious damage to the land it operates on. From being a caretaker of the land, he is now a minion serving the interests of the next quarterly earnings season. From raising rice, he now peels potatoes or cleans bottles for Pepsi as they drain the groundwater in order to make some sugared drinks that do no one any good? Wow! The man had nothing but his dignity and now you take even that away. Very efficient.

Corporate farming and monoculture bring us to the second point about the Green Revolution - sustainability. Given that the entire process of pesticide use, monocropping and groundwater overuse are unsustainable, and given that even with surplus food production in the country there has been little impact on malnutrition levels, is it indeed the humane thing to ramp up the population even further? Food security comes about not just from the quantity of the supply but also the quality. The first Green Revolution has succeeded in ruining the soil and the water. Do we now want genetically modified crops running wild? What leads to more food security - local seed banks with a wide diversity of seeds or "terminator-seeds":http://www.ethicalinvesting.com/monsanto/terminator.shtml from Monsanto? Do we prefer to have agricultural families intercropping and weeding and harvesting by hand or committing suicide under heavy debt burdens undertaken to afford industrial inputs? If ramping up food production beyond the limits of the soil, water and other ecology leads to a fragile ecosystem and pesticide resistant bugs, if industrial agriculture is one step forward and two steps back, then perhaps the correct answer to the situation would be to stop trying to ramp up agricultural production and plot an orderly return to sustainable agriculture. 

India is inherently unsuited to industrialisation. The supply chains of fertiliser and pesticide are too oppressive to the poor farmer with their use of inputs that are traded on the global commodity exchange which is now rife with speculation and market manipulation. The poor farmer is now essentially having to deal with the JP Morgans and Goldman Sachses of this world. Doesn't sound very nice does it? Where nature can provide, where traditional knowledge has worked in the past, we want to erase all that and replace it with a structure which is out of the control of the farmer, and if you ask me, out of anybody's control for that matter, operating under its own momentum and driven by the logic of profit. The treatment of a farmer's soil is now being decided by shareholders and in the boardrooms of "agri-business" comrporations on another continent. The poor man no longer has any control. And all this for what? 

Introduction of industrial methods of farming have created an unsustainable growth in population due to a temporary increase in yields. Let us now have another green revolution, please. Not only does it do nothing for general prosperity and health, in addition when we hit declining marginal productivity from the application of industrial inputs, just those many millions will have to suffer in the crash. Those that feel that organic and sustainable farming practices cannot feed our population might take a look towards Cuba.

Cuba is one country that has had success in transitioning away from industrial agriculture to organic agriculture. The collapse of the Soviet Union meant that Cuba no longer had access to industrial inputs and there were massive fuel shortages as well. Today, Cuba is a model of sustainable orgnic farming. Cuban agriculture is much more labour intensive, which makes it a much better model for India to follow. More information in these links:

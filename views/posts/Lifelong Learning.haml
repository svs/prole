Was a time when you took whatever was left over from your lifetime of work, built your house, stuck the rest into a fixed deposit and grew old with the missus. How boring. Today's retirees now have some exciting toys with which to pass the time.

So you spent your life shuffling files in some dreary office and you never asked for more than your Bajaj scooter to ferry your family on. You lived in a rented house your whole life, putting money away for the day when you would have enough to buy your piece of land and build a house on it. You educated your children and paid for their weddings. You sit now at the twilight of your life, but oh if only they would leave you in peace. But no - sir, I am your relationship manager from so-and-so broker....sir debt funds, sir equities, sir F&O, sir precious metals, sir commodities - dal, pepper, soya.

It's not even like you can choose to not play. So it's good that the game is moade more interesting by the possibility of reducing you to grinding poverty any day. Want to watch your life's savings disappear in a poof of hyperinflation? Possible. Want to see your life's savings disappear in a market crash caused by rampant insider trading? Also possible. Is gold a good investment? Find out in real time. What to invest for, deflation or inflation? Bid-ask, put-call, dividend yield, black-scholes - you don't know all of this? Time to learn you old fart.

Welcome to lifelong learning.

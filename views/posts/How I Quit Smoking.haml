h3. ...and you might too!

As the old saw goes - "quitting smoking is easy, I've done it so many times." Like all jest, there is a grain of truth in this statement. It seems quitting smoking, like anything else, takes practice. In the rest of this post, I will try and share some of the experiences I've had trying to quit and why I believe I am no longer a smoker even though it has only been three months and a few weeks since I quit.

A small history about my smoking - I started when I was 19 years old and the first cigarette I had actually made me vomit. Even so, the peer acceptance of smoking in college was quite high and before I knew it, it went from one fag to three to five to a whole pack. Grad school was worse and starting work was no better. The habit kept increasing until it was 15 a day, first thing in the morning, three before breakfast and last thing at night. So when it came to smoking, I was no lightweight. At parties, a pack plus was not even remarkable. I tried quitting multiple times, succeeding from a few hours to a few months, but more about that later. 

Here's the first thing about quitting smoking - you can't cure the disease without understanding it. And the disease (or addiction) is entirely a mind-game. People, or worse, research might say that nicotine is physiologically addictive. I can testify from personal experience that it is no such thing. The addiction is very powerful no doubt, and it is very insidious but it does not exist at a physiological level. Being a smoker is actually entirely a state of mind. The action of smoking is simply the manifestation of being a smoker. Therefore, it stands to reason, that the "addiction" has to be tackled at the level at which it exists, in the mind. Trying to resist cigarettes while the smoker mind-set remains intact is akin to trying to cure AIDS with bandages. With the underlying cause still extant, the whole exercise becomes a very painful one and often ends in failure. Even when this triumph of the will succeeds, it is often a Pyrrhic victory with each drink and each meal being another occasion to crave cigarettes. This is why things like nicotine patches and other substitutes often fail. This one insight is actually the only thing that is required to take you down the path to successfully quitting smoking. In this regard, I am very grateful to "Mr. Alan Carr":http://allencarr.com/central/, whose "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" is very helpful indeed.

So, how does one go about changing the smoker mind-set? It is possible to do so, no doubt. However one thing to keep in mind is that it can be a slow process. Those who are looking for quick fixes might be disappointed over here. I know that from the time I started to quit smoking seriously, it took me about 18 months, and this is not even counting the multiple attempts over the past 16 years. The process of quitting smoking is essentially a kind of self hypnosis where you literally have to rewire certain neuron pathways in your brain. 

The first thing to do when you want to quit smoking is to accept that smoking is bad. If you are trying to quit smoking because your doctor told you or your husband wants you to, there's little chance of success. To quit smoking, the smoker must want to quit. Even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the effect, many smokers have trouble accepting the evil of their habit. It is like finding fault with a lover - can't be done, even though those faults might be plain as day. This creation of all kinds of excuses to absolve smoking is one of the insidious effects of the nicotine addiction. The very first step to defeating the addiction is to end the denial. I will not here list the evils of smoking. They are well known, and I don't want to be all preachy and moralizing. You are an adult and besides, the exercise of doing so will be beneficial to the potential quitter.

In any case, if you can make the switch from defending smoking (i.e saying things like "who wants to live forever?", etc.) to admitting frankly that you hate smoking and the only reason you smoke is because you are addicted and that you wish you could stop but it is very hard, then congratulations my friend. You are on your way. My theory is that the dissonance caused by the conflict between your thoughts and your actions will lead to one or the other - either you change your thoughts or you change your actions. If you can hang on to the thought then slowly but surely, one day, you will no longer smoke. It is not necessary to hate cigarettes with a vengeance, to conduct campaigns against paan-wallahs or any other such thing. It is not even necessary to remind yourself of this every day. Just whenever you think of smoking if you can change the thought from a romanticisation of smoking to a wish to be free from the addiction, that is enough. Over time, you will stop smoking. The more sincere you are in this thought, the faster and more comprehensively this transition will happen. And it is not difficult to be sincere in this thought. Just look back at your ruined health, finances and relationships and you should have enough ammunition.

To accompany the change in mind-set, you also have to give your body the correct training. Stopping to smoke represents a trauma to the body which has adapted to deal with the smoke you've been inhaling. Besides, performing the action of not smoking reinforces the neural pathways required to finally become a non-smoker. Therefore, one day, before going to sleep, throw away all your cigarettes. When you wake up, don't smoke till you leave the house. If it's a weekend, even better. If you can get past the initial urge to smoke, it probably won't return for an hour or two. This is the way it seems to be with smoking urges. If they are not satisfied immediately, the go away for a little while. So try and defer giving in to the urge. Also, smoking urges come disguised in all kinds of fancy logic. It is very interesting to note all the various logical tricks the addiction will play on you to try and get you to smoke. Not having cigarettes at hand is greatly helpful in this case. Perhaps you get past lunch, even tea time. In the evening you go down to the corner to buy eggs and passing the paan-wallah, you buy a cigarette. Concentrate on this cigarette. See how foul it tastes. You have to eat a Halls just to keep from retching. Afterwards, your breath is short and your fingers smell bad. Focus on these things. They will help you push the non-smoking to its logical limit. At some point during the day, or perhaps after a day or two, your jaw will lock up, your mouth will fill with saliva. Your body is going into withdrawal. At this point, the fight becomes exponentially tougher. There is a trick to dealing with withdrawal.

The trick to dealing with withdrawal is very simple. Smoke a cigarette. As before, focus on the stench and the foul taste. Once the withdrawal symptoms have disappeared, it is very important what you think next. The smoking addiction is very crafty and it plants all kinds of thoughts in your head. The thought it plants in your head at this point is - "shit, I smoked. I've failed at giving up. No point now. Might as well get a pack." This thought is to be rejected. In its place, hold this thought - "Damn, those withdrawals. Well, now that I've taken care of that, it's back to not smoking for me. Who can voluntarily put himself through this foul experience?" Many techniques for quitting smoking make smoking a taboo or a failure. It's not. It's part of giving up. You will smoke. Just don't make a big deal out of it. 

Also note that the urge to smoke has nothing to do with how much you smoke. For example, you've gone three days without a fag and are now at the bar with some friends, dying from cigarette craving. My advice - give in.  And don't stop at one. Have as many as you want. Then, when the evening is over, go back to not smoking. If you think stopping at one is better than having ten, you are mistaken. As a matter of fact, the ten will make you sick and take away the urge to smoke for longer than the one.

The entire process can take many months. It is important to keep quitting as many times as necessary in these months. Eventually, the new neural pathways take hold and you will be free. I do not even think of cigarettes after a meal or with a drink, a far cry from the stories of smokers who even years later crave a ciggie after each meal.

It is better while quitting smoking to avoid smokers altogether. If you have a smoking group at work, well, sorry - you are going to find it exponentially harder. Likewise if your spouse or roommates also smoke. But it is still possible.

All the best.

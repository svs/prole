!{float: left}http://i306.photobucket.com/albums/nn241/newsourcevisions/tyler-durden.jpg! A common theme amongst mystics and spiritual guides is that of renunciation. Giving up attachment and desires is seen as one of the first and most important steps on the path to God-consciousness. Patanjali's yoga sutras start with "yam, niyam, pratyahara..." rules, discipline, detachment. The reason for this is simply that your slavery to sense perceptions keep you from seeing the ultimate and eternal reality, whatever that might be. 

Regular readers of this blog might have noticed the transformation in me since the birth of my son. I went from being a committed materialist and socialist to accepting the existence of God, to accepting the concept of a divinity. I magically kicked the smoking habit. the vegetarian habit finally stuck in a comprehensive manner. I quit drinking and marijuana. I started doing yoga. I also quit refined sugar and soap. I meditate daily. I eat only fruits for breakfast. I even quit tea and coffee. In short I have been engaged in an experiment to see what it was that the yogis actually knew. All this stuff that they wrote doen 3000 years ago - how much truth does it contain? This post is a small report about the effects of renunciation.

First of all, let me just say that vairagya is not just for yogis. It can be a wonderful tool for personal development and progress as a human being even if enlightenment is not your ultimate goal. And the best part? for everything you give up, you get something even nicer in return. 

Giving up sugar was my first revealation. The first cup of tea tasted bitter, the second less so and by the second day I realised I'd never actually tasted tea in my life before. All I'd been tasting was sugar. Bonus? everything else started tasting sweeter. Sugar was setting the sweetness bar very high in my mind and without sugar, fruits got sweeter, desserts got cloyingly sweet, pepsi and coke are out of the question (my teeth start to tingle). I suspect that the white refined sugar we eat has some hard core chemical properties because simply giving up those three or so tea-spoons of daily sugar accelerated my weight loss and I have managed to keep most of it off without too much trouble.

It is a common belief that tea and coffee help you wake up in the morning but my own experience is that giving up tea and coffee actually helps you wake up better each morning? As a caffeine addict, the quality of your sleep is invariably poor. Infact, you're spending the last few hours of your sleep craving caffeine rather than sleeping. You wake up groggy and reach for a cup of coffee, thus perpetuating the addiction. To break it needs three days and you will wake up "bright eyed and bushy tailed" as the saying goes. This is especially helpful if you have a little kid in the house. When he calls out to you in the morning from the cot at the crack of dawn, it is so nice to be able to return his wide smile with one of your own rather than stumple groggily out of bed to put on the kettle.

There is no need to talk in detail about giving up smoking and drinking but there is one thing I would like to say about marijuana. First of all though, I would still reccommend marijuana in small quantities. The dissolution of the ego while under the influence is a nice glimpse of God-consciousness and it is good to calibrate ones progress and be reminded of what it is that one is working towards. However, having been clean for several years I can confidently state that regular marijuana use engenders a state of psychosis and paranoia, mild or otherwise. Ever noticed how regular smokers never end up achieving anything? That's dope for you. Use it sparingly and be ever alert for the pitfalls.

Funnily enough, the renunciation wagon is now running under its own steam. Quite without any effort on my part, I seem to have fallen into a natural state of sexual continence. The vast swathes of internet porn do nothing for me. The images on TV and magazines that are designed to titillate only make me laugh. I can now relate to members of the opposite sex as human beings rather than be distracted by the shape of their body.

Giving up things can become a habit. There is some mental process involved in ending the craving for any given thing and this mental process can be applied to any sort of renunciation. So the electricity is out and it is hot like anything? Simply turn this mental process towards giving up air-conditioning. Lift broken? Bus too crowded? Traffic horrible? all these situations can be turned into another opportunity to renounce your cravings. Life's little difficulties lose their epic nature and become minor inconveniences. In time you will no longer even notice them.

All of this of course is what the yogis were talking about. You will soon no longer be distracted by anger, jealousy, desire. The various transgressions against your self-heroism will appear now to be the petulant complaints of a mewling ego, a small and laughable problem. And all this of course will give you the ability, in time so they say, to love, to love unconditionally and in this unconditional love to find God.

There's that famous line from Dune - Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.

So true.

A combination of Dimitry Orlov, Voltaire and Rage Against the Machine brought me to the idea that tickets should be the next currency. 

A ticket essentially represents a claim on anything, just like money. In current parlance tickets refer to claims mainly on peformances and public transportation but there is no reason why the ticket could not buy meals, conumer durables, public services or telecommunications access. A ticket is sold by a promoter and bought by a consumer. There exists also a particular thing or experience, the delivery of which is the basis of the transaction. Tickets can be issued by anyone for anything (within the framework of the law...or perhaps even not).

Such a system would have several cool things about it. To wit,
# It would be real money in the sense that every bit of currency in circulation would be backed by an actual physical thing. While being a real currency, it would still not suffer from the shortcomings of other "real" currencies such as gold by being extremely elastic in supply. It's value would not depend on the scarcity of the currency but rather on the scarcity (or abundance) of the ticketed item. i.e. brown rice prices will have to do more with the economic realities of the buyers region and not on global interest rate policy.
# It would remove the monopoly of Central Banks on printing money since the exchange of tickets will be perfectly legal. Anyone can print "money", so to speak. The market would provide a basis for judging the value of those tickets. Central Banks, in the end, are the ultimate market imperfection. It is a testament to the efficacy of capitalist propaganda the this institution which completely corrupts the "free market system" has been accepted as a critical component of the same. The monopoly to print money, when coupled with the coercive power to collect taxes, represents less a facilitation of trade and commerce than a form of oppression.
# Tickets are quasi local currencies. While there is no reason why someone from a distant place cannot buy tickets for performances in another place, chances are that most tickets would be exchanged locally and thus keep local economies thriving. A ticket can always be converted into cash for long distance transfer. It's convertibility into cash allows the ticket system to grow alongside the monetary system and thus represents creeping subversion instead of outright and traumatic overthrow.
# For the above reason, it would allow for the emergence of a "real economics". Economics can return to the original meaning - housekeeping, the arrangement of productive capacity to achieve the aims of society -- rather than some arcane, quasi-religion about multipliers and Laffer curves.
# Tickets allow for better flow of information between buyers and sellers. People can demand things by signalling their willingness to pay for a ticket, advance bookings if you will. People in a position to provide will do so given adequate demand or adequate compensation either in cash or in other tickets. Some providers will eventually specialise in the exchange of tickets and thus become local points of reference for ticket value. Eventually, through the use of these clearing houses, information about the relative value of various tickets will disseminate through the economy and will make transacting in tickets as convenient as money.

The ticket system basically means that it is the creation of items rather than the creation of debt which allows for the human species to exchange productive cappabilities.The problem of introducing a new kind of money is always of finding the correct starting point - who has how much of what to start with? Since the ticket is not a giver of value but simply a tag on an item, this problem is dealt with. The money is just a name. And since everything has a name, there will always be exactly the same amount of money in the world as things with names.

This money will be much freer than central bank provided money. Infact the whole central banking system begins to look absurd in front of what one might call a Proletarian Monetary System.

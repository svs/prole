Dimitry Orlov is a doomer's doomer and he writes a superb doomer blog at "cluborlov.com":http://cluborlov.com. Most intelligent people will concede that the current paradigms of human society are clearly unsustainable. Exponential growth in limited systems is a mathematical impossibility and the only debate is about whether a new myth and a new paradigm will arise before or after catastrophic system collapse.

I leave you with a very touching guest post at cluborlov.com. Here's a small excerpt

bq. Unfortunately, I feel the pernicious influence of all this on my own family right here and now. You don't have to be a brilliant visionary to realize that in the current situation all these endless suburbs, built on the North American model, are slowly but surely turning into mass graves for the millions of former members of the middle class. Those that do not turn into mass graves will become nature preserves - stocked with wild animals that were once human. My family is turning feral under my very eyes. Lack of resources has forced us to live according to the Soviet model - three generations under one roof. There are six of us, of which only one works, who is, consequently, exasperated and embittered. The rest of the household is gradually going insane from idleness and boredom. The television is never turned off. The female side of the family has been sucked into social networks and associated toys. Everyone is cultivating their own special psychosis, and periodically turns vicious. In these suburbs, a person without a car is as if without legs, and joblessness does not allow any of us to earn money for gas, and so the house is almost completely isolated from the outside world.

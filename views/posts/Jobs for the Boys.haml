It seems natural for the human mind to take things it has always known and put them into the category of "things that have always been", and perhaps even into the category of "things that will always be". The current economic paradigm seems to be one such thing. Wherein actually the whole thing is based on illusion, it has in the minds of people the immutability and permanence of the very planet we inhabit. Several complimentary themes arise while discussing the economic situation.

The first is of course the canard that "people want development". One can easily point to the millions that throng Mumbai from the hinterland and call it proof positive that life in the village is no longer en vogue, that opportunities for advancement exist only in the urban centers and that modernity and progress will be defined by the number of people who have unfettered access to unlimited consumption. This is so obvious to many people that it does not even bear debate. The truth, however, tends to be more complex than that. I do not claim that I know the truth about this matter but I do know one thing - human beings have figured out long ago how to feed and clothe themselves, how to birth and raise their children, how to heal themselves and how to pass their time on earth. The idea that a village cannot feed and clothe itself is ludicrous. Had this been the case, there would have been no human race. We would all have died, hungry and shivering, millenia ago. That these models of self-sufficiency are suddenly inadequate need not be debated. I can also see the multitudes thronging to the urban centers. My question is - why? How come? I do not automatically buy the logic that because so many people are voting with their feet to come live next to Inorbit Mall, that what we need is more Inorbit Malls. Can we think of some reasons? Caste relations? Hidden state agenda? Colonialism? Soil crisis? But who wants to go there? Can't we just accept that the bright shining lights are the way forward?

The second canard is somewhat similar - people need jobs. Yes, in this current economic system where access to credit is the ultimate weapon to control behaviour, one does need a job. But instead of wondering how this human race survived millenia without anything called a "job", we immediately accept (and boy, does the propaganda make it easy to accept) the fact that "people need jobs". Never do we weigh against this the idea that birds need forests or that people need justice and dignity or that our moral and spiritual beings also need nourishment. Hidden behind the statement that "people need jobs" is actually another statement which is so stark in its simplicity - I want Ipad. If ever you see a young gent or lady in jeans speaking in English telling you that people need jobs, you can translate this as "I want iPad. I am a winner in this setup. I will not have this taken from me." Whatever 'this' is. I ask you to look around for yourselves, and if you can, to see the birds falling from the sky.

To me, the ultimate evolution of a man is directed towards the point where he can be happy just sitting under a tree. the irony is that bombarded as we are by messages touting this or that product as a step towards happiness, we as a species reached and passed this point long ago. For example, the aboriginals of Australia are legendary for their ability to just sit under a tree. I assume that they were happy to just be.  Even today in those parts of India that "modernity" is just reaching, or amongst those people of a generation that never knew modernity, you can find this amazing ability to just sit. I have no idea what is going through the minds of these people as they sit. There's no need to describe it in fancy terms such as "contemplating God" and what not, but certainly the ability to just "be happy" is an amazing achievement. I find though that not everyone shares my aspiration. Some hungry souls need to fill up their empty spaces with facebook or farmville. For this, they are willing to disregard everything. I want iPad!!

I long believed that redistributing income would solve most of our problems as a society but I now believe that while this hole exists in our soul, we can never make real progress.

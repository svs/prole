<h1>A new  blog is born</h1>
<p>
In the heat of a Mumbai afternoon, the prole sits down to create a new blog engine? Why? Not just because he can but also because existing blog engines are too fancy. Not proletarian enough. Substance over form and all that. Armed with the ruby programming language and inspiration from projects like Tom Preston-Warner's <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, the prole decides he too would like to be like those cool kids who host their blog on github. Enter blu.rb, the sinatra-based, minimal blog engine.
</p>
<p>
Blu.rb (it's "blurb", not "blue dot aar bee") will publish put any file under the views/posts directory in the blog index. Adding a .erb extension will give the post the layout in views/layout.rb (please read some Sinatra documentation. Blu.rb is simply a Sinatra app). With no extension, you are free to provide any arbitrary html code.

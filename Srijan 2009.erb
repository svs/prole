h1. Srijan 2009

Srijan 2009, the microfinance forum and awards night hosted by Intellecap concluded today. I had the pleasure of being there. The event consists of small presentations and panel discussions through the day, followed by an awards ceremony honouring the best MFIs.

Microfinance events are becoming rapidly corporatised. Everyone was in suits, and everyone there had a commercial stake in the industry. It was only the presence of Vijay Mahajan and Rajni Bakshi that lent a dissenting voice to an otherwise homogenous gathering. 

The panels were full of industry people and the level of controversy in the discussions was a victim of this fact. The panel on Social vs Commercial really missed the presence of a dissenting voice. Wim Van der Beek, founder of Goodwell and the moderator of the panel tried gamely to spark some controversy but was limited by his role as a moderator. Even so, the panelists said nothing really interesting. Rajni was sorely missed on this panel. Her new book 'bazaar, conversations and freedom' was available at the event. I got a copy. The two chapters I managed to read instead of paying attention to the panels were very lucid, asking some very important questions and with very correct politics. I can't wait to read more. Besides, she has met Stallman. How cool is that?

The awards were let down by the lack of any real disclosure on why the winners won. For example, lets say you gave someone the award for most transparent MFI. Now wouldn't you want to say something specific about why this was done? the jurors often had a tough time pointing to something very specific about the winner. One of the jurors even said that there was really nothing to choose from between the contestants.
During Sankalp there were nice videos of the contestants. While videos might have been too difficult to organise, some more information about the winners would have been appreciated. Perhaps they are planning to address this in their next issue of Microfinance Insights?

The lack of wifi ensured that no one could tweet about the event. Certainly the number of laptops were far less than at any other microfinance event I have been to.
